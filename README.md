### <a name="about_me">About Me</a>


I am an enthusiastic, outgoing and ambitious full stack developer looking forward to starting my career in the tech industry. Excited by technology and computers and enquistive about how they worked from an early age, I decided it was about time I learnt how to code. I started my journey with online codeacademy tutorials before deciding to step it up a notch by applying to one of Europe's leading development bootcamps, Makers Academy.

I pride myself on my interpersonal skills which have been honed by working in sales, fitness and training environments, and also my ability to adapt and learn new skills especially when pushed outside my comfort zone.

**Makers Academy**

Currently I'm near the end of my 12 weeks as a Makers Academy student. It's been challenging, at times frustrating, but always enjoyable. Working on projects both alone and as part of a team has tested my ability to work under pressure, find solutions to tricky problems and take in new information on a daily basis. Due to the structure of the course I am pair programming daily, often well into the evening, as well as working on weekend challenges by myself.

**Communication**

In my previous roles I have worked with a wide range of clients, students and employees with varying ages and levels of expertise in their fields and engaging with each person to understand their strengths, weaknesses and motivations. I believe communication is key to a successful working relationship whether it's explaining a tricky technical concept to somebody, giving a presentation, asking for assistance or even just providing an update on the current status of a project I'm working on. I pride myself on my ability on to adjust my approach depending on the target audience and prevent any miscommunication from occurring.

**Critical Reasoning and Problem Solving**

Another skill I have improved during my time in education and employment is my ability to critically analyse situations and provide simple solutions to problems. Working as a employability trainer, I regularly had to think on my feet and ensure that the materials were tailored to their learning styles to ensure they progressed their knowledge. While working as a personal trainer, I was constantly assessing clients responsiveness to training and provide positive feedback and client engagement from both novice and professional athletes.

### <a name="interests">Interests</a>

I am a keen sportsman from a young age, I have played hockey from the age of 5 and have competed at international level with Scotland. It has taught me a lot about commitment and team work, it is one of my greatest achievements. I enjoy keeping fit by going to the gym and playing various other sports, I am a keen golfer although my skills are somewhat lacking on the golf course.
